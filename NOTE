The PERL scripts are developed to search regions carring short motif within a long reference sequence.


Usage:
./find-seqmotif.pl  (fasta file) (motif sequence)
 
fasta file     : The file should contain one nucleotide reference sequence.
motif sequence : The short motif sequence is defined. 
                 The sequence can be defined with the letters "A", "T(not U)", "G", "C", as well as "Y", "R", "N".

The script outputs positions of 5'-end nucleotides of the identified regions carring the defined motif.
In addition, the script outputs sequences at the identified regions, with extra information on two flanking nucleotides at each of 5'- and 3'-ends.

Example)
./find-seqmotif.pl EColi_BL21DE3.fasta YACCCGGY > output1.csv
./find-seqmotif.pl EColi_BL21DE3.fasta YYRCCGGGT > output2.csv




Usage:
./find-pair.pl  (output1) (output2)
 
output1/output2 : These are outputs of "find-seqmotif.pl" with two distinct motif sequences

The script automatically sorts positions of the identified regions within the two files.
In addition, it highlights positions of pair sequences within <100 bp.

Example)
./find-pair.pl output1.csv output2.csv > output12.csv
